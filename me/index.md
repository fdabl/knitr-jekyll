# About
I've done my undergraduate studies in Psychology at the University of Graz, Austria,
taking elective courses in Philosophy and Computer Science. During this time, I became intrigued by how
the ever increasing availability of data and sophistication of statistical modeling will, eventually, transform
the study of human behaviour. Tal Yarkoni calls the thus emerging discipline [*Psychoinformatics*](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721412457362), and
Tom Griffiths is even calling for a [new (computational) cognitive revolution](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027714002467).

This interest lead me to the wonderful city of TÃ¼bingen where I'm currently
writing my thesis at Daimler Research & Development in pursuance of a Master's degree
in Cognitive Science. During my studies, I've worked as a research assistant in the junior group of Michael Franke at the Department of Linguistics where I programmed interactive experiments for the web, helped with data analysis, and co-taught a class on Bayesian statistics. At the Department of Psychology, I too worked as a research assistant where I programmed a HTML5 experience sampling app and helped with data analysis and automation.

I am passionate about open science, novel developments in methodology and applied statistics, and scientific publishing. Aligned with these interests, I am an editor for the [Journal of European Psychology Students](http://jeps.efpsa.org/) where we have, as one of the first journals, implemented *Registered Reports*.

As hobbies, I like creating vegan dishes, meditating, running, and learning how to play the guitar.
